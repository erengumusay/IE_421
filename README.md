Question 1: Does Monday Syndrome have an effect on traffic density in Istanbul?
We will be investigating the possible correlation between ‘Monday Syndrome’, that refers to lacking motivation, having less willpower and feeling anxious to start the week, and Istanbul’s traffic. By analyzing the hourly and daily traffic density datasets provided by IBB, we will compare Monday to other weekdays.

Question 2: How do the Football Matches of ‘The Big Three’ affect the traffic in Istanbul?
The football matches of ‘The Big Three’ (Besiktas, Fenerbahce and Galatasaray) are known to be attended by large crowds. This question examines the potential traffic spikes before, during and after the matches utilizing match schedules and hourly traffic density data of Istanbul.

Question 3: Can newly introduced subway lines convince car owners to switch to public transportation in Istanbul? 
This research will aim to answer are new subway lines being successful about the traffic problem in Istanbul by convincing car owners to switch to public transportation or is it just an easier way to transport for people who already do not use cars for their daily transportation. Hourly traffic density data will be used to examine the number of cars in subway routes before and after the lines were put into service.
